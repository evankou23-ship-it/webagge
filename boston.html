        <h1 class="h">Boston Trip (Feb. 2025)</h1>
        <h4>Pep road trip to Dartmouth and Harvard; and we got to spend the day in Boston! First up was our journey to Hanover, leaving Friday afternoon after classes. </h4>

        <p>Bus ride to New Hampshire was quite stunning in the winter. Nothing but snow and ski mountains. A few hours later, we arrive at Dartmouth.</p>

        <p> Big Green got nothing on the RPI when we have three trumpets of varying sizes. Chloe does not play trumpet.</p>

        <p> It was good game through the first, RPI holding our own against Big Green. Right until the 2nd period and WE SCORE!!! Jakob Lee pulls through with the first goal of game. 
            Dartmouth fans do not look too happy by the 2nd intermission, and sadly they reciprocate early in the 3rd period. Hey is that Tate McRae's brother? </p>

        <p>With 7 minutes left, Jakob Lee scores AGAIN!! Dartmouth pep band is not happy and heckling us. Their trombone player has to learn to annunciate annunciate ahh ahh ahh. Soon enough they pull their goalie and all we can do is hope and pray...Giesbrecht must lock in.</p>
        <img src="/pictures/WinatDartMouth.png" alt="RPI DUB" style="width:400px;height:300px;">
        <p>...5..4..3..2..1..YESS!!!! HUGE 2-1 DUB for RPI against #3 in ECAC at the time! How about them 'Neers?</p>
        <br>After Let Give a Cheering outside in the snow, it was time to head back to the hotel and prepare for a day in Boston.

        <p>My New Yorker senses told me to leave upon smelling the first whiff of Bostonian air, but it actually wasn't that bad. Quincy Market was bustling, especially with nice warm food on this cold day. We got some chowda and headed for the streets. Posting up on the Boston harbor goes a little hard. Give it up for the saxes.</p>

        <p>Boston Commons was literally a winter wonderland. With the entire pond frozen over, there were people skating, playing hockey (go Red), having a grand old time. Safe to say the city had all their ducks in a row.</p>

        <p>Apparently, some skateboarding competition was going on in the middle of town. Maura and Ed needed a better view.</p>

        <p>Alright I know I know enough dilly and dallying. How about those 'Neers? Well it was quite an underwhelming arena compared to the Field House, but so many RPI fans were there! Great so see some friendly faces in OPs territory.</p>
        <img src="/pictures/gameonHarvard.jpg" alt="Harvard Ice Rink" style="width:450px;height:400px;">
        <p>By the second period it was 0-2 Harvard, big time no bueno. So we go to superband with Harvard band (who is annoyingly so nice) and what do they have? A FLIPBOOK OF FACTS ON ALL OUR PLAYERS?? Looks like somebody has a crush on Giesbrecht (who doesn't though). It was pretty funny when we mentioned it to them, cause you gotta respect the hustle.  </p>

        <p>Third period started dire, but four minutes in RPI scores!! What time is it? Clearly they knew it was comeback time because we scored AGAIN! Time to bust out the "SAAAFETY SCHOOOOL!!!!". It was a great third period, but with three minutes left, the Crimson scored a final time, to seal a 3-2 win. Rats.  </p>

        <p>It was a game well played by both teams, and happy to report, it was NOT awkward clapping for our team outside afterward.</p>
