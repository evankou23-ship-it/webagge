        <p>Bus ride to New Hampshire was quite stunning in the winter. Nothing but snow and ski mountains. A few hours later, we arrive at Dartmouth.</p>

        <p> Big Green got nothing on the RPI when we have three trumpets of varying sizes. Chloe does not play trumpet.</p>

        <p> It was good game through the first, RPI holding our own against Big Green. Right until the 2nd period and WE SCORE!!! Jakob Lee pulls through with the first goal of game. 
            Dartmouth fans are not happy during the 2nd intermission, and sadly they reciprocate early in the 3rd period.</p>

        <p>With 7 minutes left, Jakob Lee scores AGAIN!! Dartmouth pep band is not happy and heckling us. Their trombone has to learn to annunciate annunciate ahh ahh ahh. Soon enough they pull their goalie and all we can do is hope and pray...Giesbrecht must lock in.</p>
