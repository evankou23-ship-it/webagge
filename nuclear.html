        <h2>Rankings of all NukE classes:</h2>
        <p>1. Radiological Engineering (Fritz) <br> 
        <pre>
    Clinically the coolest class. You learn about how radiation effects the body, 
    all the different units (gray, X, Roentgen, rem (yay), Sievert (bleh)). Lots
    of stuff is conceptual and fact-based knowledge, and you get a real intuition
    on radiological hazards and what is "bad."
        </pre>
    <p>2. NIM (Fritz) <br> 
        <pre>
    Love those GM counters, and all those gas-filled chambers. Only caveat is that
    we barely got to see/use these devices. If we did it'd be maximum awesome.
        </pre>

    <p>3. Phenom (Liu) <br> 
        <pre>
    Here we have a very smooth course that I think successfully introduces you to all 
    basic nuclear concepts. Very good as a first semester sophomore, but I argue it's 
    too sleeper because Fundies will hit you like a train. Also Liu is an angel but 
    might not teach the course again ):
        </pre>
    <p>4. PNR aka Fundies 2.0 (Danon) <br> 
        <pre>
    Can't deny, neutronics can be very interesting, just some homeworks were sinister. 
    Deriving simply is not it. You'll see resonance integrals when you close your eyes
    for the whole semester.
        </pre>
    <p>5. Fundies (Kang) <br> 
        <pre>
    Look Kang is very nice but sadly the content was bonkers compared to Phenom the 
    semester before. However, it was the first actual nuclear that felt like "yea,
    this is gonna be really cool."
        </pre>
    <p>6. INE (Malaviya) <br> 
        <pre>
    Can't remember how many times Malaviya showed up, but he was an absolute angel and
    we love him. Having all the NukE teachers present is nice, but when you're a Freshman
    chances are you have no idea what they are talking about when they discuss their research.
        </pre>
    
    <p>7. Nuclear Mat Sci (Lian) <br> 
        <pre>
    WARNING: TAKE AT YOUR OWN RISK. This class should require pre-reqs, but it doesn't for
    some reason. Don't take this as a freshman. Please.
