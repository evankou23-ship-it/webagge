            <p>So SOME people have been talking about how I haven't been updating the blog, so here I am. Today at Commons there was this Heath hot chocolate that everyone agreed was life changing. We now live in a post-hot chocolate world. Welp. Maura just spilled all her root beer onto the table. Oh, wait it's not even all, she is still drinking the remainding root beet from her cup. This is like the sixth time she has spilled soda on technology, actually amazing. </p>

            <p>Blog #2. Today was the heat transfer final! It was happily pretty sleeper, but the last thing for this semester is sadly the entire URP research paper. U-238 photofission done, 3 more sections to go. Adrian recommended a comments section for this blog which I think would be really funny, so if that can work out I think it'd be necessary. If not, a donation page like the Integral Calculator guy would work. Please, buy me a coffee. Just a struggling nuclear engineer here. </p>
 
        <h3>12/10/25 Wednesday</h3>
            <p>This is my first blog test! The website is coming
                 along swimmingly, and I have my heat transfer final tomorrow. 
                 Sitting here at the table instead of studying... 
                 After that gotta do my entire URP research paper for radioxenon production uh oh. Hyper Thursday incoming. (Wow what a historic moment this is! Hello to whoever scrolled all the way down!)</p>
