        <h3>  1/27/26 Tuesday   </h3>         <h3>   1/26/26 SNOW DAY!!!  </h3>                        <img alt="A car buried in snow." src="/blogphotos/carinsnow.jpg"  style="float:right;width:150px;height:130px;">

            <p>Back to reality... But actually not really cause it's still wild outside. Walking to breakfast this morning and there were cars completely covered with only the windshield wipers to imply any semblance of an automobile. Got some work done but later went down to J to check on my car that I left there after Mayor's Cup. Luckily, not as bad as the picture of that car. I found a nearby shovel and started clearing it, but then a Pubsafe officer walked out of J and asked what I was doing (again?!) to which I answered honestly. To my surprise he told me to sit tight and he walked to his car and came back with a snowbrush to help me out! We cleared out my car enough to possibly drive to the LINAC tomorrow, so huge shoutout to Officer Manny for helping me out.

                On another note, Zachtronics got back to me about the Shenzhen cards!!! Although his response was just...a little unenthusiastic. I told him I'm a huge fan of the game, the solitaire, and that I'm an RPI student just like he was, but all he emailed back were a couple of <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=mhing+game">Ebay links</a> of cards from a game called Mhing. The thing is, they don't really look exactly like the in-game cards, so I fear creating a custom deck is the only way to go. Although I must say, I truly appreciate getting a response from an alum as successful as he is, and I understood the brevity of the email. His company has a wikipedia page and his email is literally @zachtronics.com, so I feel like he knows what's up. Well our first actual lab in LINAC lab is tomorrow, so I'll update you guys on how that goes tomorrow. 
            </p>
        <h3>   1/26/26 SNOW DAY!!!  </h3>                        <img alt="Highland Ave after Winter Storm 2026" src="/blogphotos/snow2026.jpg"  style="float:right;width:150px;height:130px;">

            <p>Alright so technically not a Snow Day but this is the closest we'll get In-person classes were legally cancelled, so they were forced to be held online which honestly I'll take it. Now Applied Reactor Analysis was straight cancelled, so we'll return on Thursday going three weeks into the semester and had only gone to class twice... Snow is coming down steady today, and the results are crazy. The image from outside does not give it justice -- it is almost apocalyptic. Arthur and I agree, it might just be the most snow from one storm we've seen in our lives. Had this thought the other day: it'd be crazy if all the snow fell at once.  </p>
            <h3>    1/25/26 Sunday </h3>
            <p>Today was Day 1 of the Winter Storm 2026. It's cool when the talk of the town for the past few days is this big storm that's going to happen, then when it actually does happen it is simply bonkers. We were talking about this yesterday, but how did people in like 1900 know if there was going to be a massive blizzard? Simply they did not. 
                Maybe they get letters from their friends in the North where the storm hit first, but that's all they could do, right? Suddenly it started snowing then boom it's a blizzard. I think they'd have no idea when it would stop snowing and it would just stink. Today the snow started atound 11am and even 5 hours in by 4pm it was already nearing a foot. This was just 5 hrs out of the over 24 hour snowfall. Just imagine you're a peasant in the Victorian Era wondering when will this blasted winter end, and you just have no idea.
                <br>
                <br>
                On another note, played Bridge with some of the Nukes today and it is so much thinking and strategy, nearly cannot fathom. We have the basics down but keeping track of points is by far the hardest part to learn. You get points for each trick over 6, depending on trump suit, but no trump gets you extra but only for first trick over 6, but below the contract it's a greater penalty, and if your team has vulnerable status it's actually a GREATER penalty, 
                and you getter hope it's not doubled, oh but if one of those special game contracts you get more bonus points. I feel like we discovered a brand new really niche rule every game for scoring, and I just think it'd be so funny to get really good at Bridge. 
            </p>
        <h3>   1/24/26 Saturday  </h3>
            <p>Pretty sure this whole day will be documented on another page in the website. There's something about spending an entire day watching very intense hockey. It's a shared experience with only the people in that stadium; I really enjoy those "you had to be there" scenarios a lot." Sometimes it's impossible to understand something from another's POV unless you have had the exact same experiences as that other person; you just have no way of knowing. Anyway definitely just coping right now. Went to Vermont and Mass today too. </p>
        <h3>   1/22/26 Thursday  </h3>
            <p>Rabbit hole of the week: RPI website on the Wayback Machine. Go to my misc links to explore yourself, cause there are so many tiny litte details of early Internet that you simply never get anymore, a literal time capsule of 30 years ago. It's weird 30 years ago feels like a long time, but the Internet was alive and thriving, and websites were popping up everywhere. This whole thing even inspired me to start this site, and it why you're reading this right now. One of these details is that very often you come across directions to get places. If people wanted to meet somewhere, you simply had to know where to go, so websites had directions like taking exits off highways or driving through freeways and taking a left at this or that landmark. Obvsiously it's not weird, but it kind of it to think that these were the college days of people just like us who were literally the same people with the same humor. In fact I guarentee that the college students of 2056 reading this are like "man, I can't believe everyone had Instagram profiles to showcase their whole life that's crazy!" Yet here we are. Anyway, go to my <a href="Links.html">Links</a> page to check this out and explore to your heart's content. Your homework is to email me about anything you find interesting, I will definitely find it cool too! That's it for today, so see you tomorrow. </p>
        <h3>   1/21/26 Wednesday  </h3>
            <p>It feels like last week was a month ago. So much happened in between since last Wednesday that the entirety of break feels like about a week. Anyway, Commons had these homemade Twix bars as an ST (see <a href="wordlist.html">initialisms</a>) and it was divine. Anyway, always something happening with LINAC lab, and while we there, P made his 2026th <a href="Links.html">Shenzhen.io Solitaire</a> win, and can no longer play until 2027. We also started using this new Monte Carlo called SRIM for ions that looks like it was made the same year as this website looks like it was made. It's public software so I can show it here, and it is simply amazing. Also you can't change the aspect ratio/fullscreen; it's stuck at a charming postage stamp size. But we love nuclear code. <img alt="SRIM interface. You can't make this up." src="/blogphotos/srim.png"  style="float:right;width:180px;height:160px;">            
                
                <br>
                <br>
                Alright back to Shenzhen. So you remember how the original game was made by an RPI alum and we flipped out? Well during dinner we were curious...could we get our hands on a real life Shenzhen deck? I was certain. To do this, we'd need the actual textures from the game for accuracy, so who else to ask but Zachtronics himself, creator of Shenzhen.io and Infiniminer (original predecessor to Minecraft), and RPI class of '08? So, I contacted him using school email to see what he can do, promising a copy of the deck if I can make it happen, BCCing Bob and Maddie as to include them but not scare off Zachtronics with all this pressure. Probably the first use of BCC this year. That said, can only pray to hear what he makes of this, so stay tuned for Zachtronics updates!  </p>
        <h3>   1/20/26 Tuesday </h3>
                        <img alt="Saratoga Water Spring" src="/blogphotos/watersara.jpg"  style="float:right;width:110px;height:130px;"><img alt="Marshmallows in Saratoga" src="/blogphotos/marshmallow.jpg"  style="float:right;width:130px;height:150px;">            
    
        <p>Hey Friendships, I heard about my lack of blogging recently, and first I'd like to apologize. I think I just closed my Visual Studio Code app which is usually in my taskbar to remind my update the blog every day. Well boy do I have quite the story: so yesterday Maddie, P, and I visited Saratoga for the bit, and we first tried the many water springs they've. I don't want to spoil the experience but you'll definitely know which one is the best out of the 6 or so. Interestingly, many of these springs have dissolved iron which give it this disgusting <i>tufa</i> around it. Yuck. Anyway, they also had a little fire going so you could roast some marshmallows on the snowy afternoon and warm your hands. Hmm I think it's time to make another paragraph.  
            <br>
            <br>
            So we get to town and explore the shops including a very quaint bookstore, probably best one I've ever been in terms of vibes. We then come to a crossroads: P enters a cigar store draped with American flags -- probably the most conservative room I've ever witnessed. Maddie and I enter this nutty crystal/astrology shop being the most liberal room ever witnessed. I asked about any rocks with uranium just to test their limits but they didn't seem to like that. In the back there were some real nutty books, and they asked where we were from we just said Troy as to not blow our cover completely. I declined to be "read" whatever that means and we promptly booked it. We ate at Bailey's Cafe, but we were not prepared for our next destination: what seemed to be thrift store was actually a confinement store with clothing cramped so close like a Minecraft base with one block wide hallways and two block tall roof. It is in a basement, and as you enter down from stairs from the street, clothing racks covered everything. When we were the ready to leave, the kind lady thanked us for coming, and asked where we were from. Again, we just say Troy, to which she responds by stating she just read an article saying that's in the top 10 worst places in NY to live. Well alright, thanks lady. She continues going on about how some places are nicer than others, such as Russia. We kinda wanna see where she's going with this so we sorta get her to keep talking until she's on about how Ukraine is not a real country and that Russia will take what's rightfully theirs. All we can do is just nod politely like mm yep mm yep. THEN she gets quiet and says, "you know what, something BIG is gonna happen tomorrow..." "Huh? What are you talking about?" "I'm not saying anything else...but something big..." We all looked at each other like yep, that's our cue, and politely exited, all looking wide-eyed like what the hell did we just witness. 
            <br>
            <br>
            That brings us to today, where we've all been on the lookout for "something big." The annoything is that ANYTHING could happen and she'd be right. There is only half hour left of the day, and if nothing happens, P and I decided we're driving back to Saratoga to ask what the hell she was on about. Then, I'm sure New York State Fire Code would like to have a chat with her. Well seems like a proper length for a blog post. Expect more. Thanks again for the emails, I really do appreciate them.

        <h3>   1/13/26 Tuesday </h3>
            <p>Welcome to Spring 26! It's been great to be back for two days, and finally be mentally stimulated again. Every class, even freshman MatSci was the most interesting thing ever compared to most of the last three weeks. Infinite Minecraft and TV must come to an end, and with no more loose ends from the winter break, it's back to grind time. </p>
        <h3>    1/7/26 Wednesday </h3>
            <p>Whoa... I feel like it's been a while. LOTS have happened so far: watched SO much tv, played SO much Minecraft, and actually painted some things. No but honestly, I don't think anyone else on Earth has watched six hours of Severance into six hours of The Odd Couple in one day all after metagaming the<abbr title="Minecraft Card Game"> MCCG</abbr>, pretty sure I got that record on lock. </p>
        <h3>   12/29/25 Monday  </h3>

Heading to the city today, we had to find a way to fill the void between Christmas and New Years "NYE" Eve. That initialism is so dumb; I mean who says those letter out loud anyway? 
                Should add that on <a href="wordlist.html" >my least favorite word list</a>. Getting ahead of ourselves huh. You really understand museums a lot more going back when you're consious. Seeing all these toddlers at the AMNH made me wonder how many of them really appreciate what they're looking at? 
Sure the hanging whale and diaramas are amazing, but there was one small thing that oddly stuck out to me this time around: in the African exhibit there was a one-off glass display case housing various artifacts, and one of them was this ivory tusk, carved away intricately to show a snake spiraling around the tusk. Along the snake lay figures of people doing various activities, all carved by hand and preserved for so long. There is no way a snotty 7 year old me would have appreciated that! Yet I figured the value me coming here so long ago was being able to remember the big parts of it, and feel nostalgic coming back all these years later. That said, it was enlightening going back with friends who could also appreciate the exhibits. With the city being super packed around this time, we hopped back on the LIRR and booked it by the evening after taking some great Where's Waldo among the crowds.  </p>
        <h3>  12/26/25 Thursday🎄  </h3>
            <p>Winter break Me has gone too far. Apparently he doesn't care about sleep at all, that upon staying up until 3 am, he was like "you know what? no sleep for you." Stayed consious in bed until the birds started chirping into Christmas Eve and I arose an mixture between sleepy and awake, a sleepwalking semi-awake lethargic abomination. Like why's that gotta happen?? Then had to endure Christmanukah going into 40 hours awake (although very yummy food) until finally I was allowed to sleep. Pretty messed up, huh. Anyway Christmas was cool, the Chinese food was great, and watched 12 Angry Men for some reason today (very good film, original of course). Very hard to come across new and exciting thoughts these days, but we'll get back to it. </p>
        <h3>  12/23/25 Tuesday?   </h3>
            <p>Winter break Me has officially taken over, and there are still two weeks left for him to reign. He makes me get up past 10 am, go to sleep past 2 am, and I fear it will only get more extreme the more Minecraft there is to play. He warps my sense of time, where I'm pretty sure last time I did actual work was 3 months ago but it was probably like 1.5 weeks ago. Wait wasn't the Fluids final today?? Poor Mane students still at RPI. Also figured out at least top 3 worst activity these past days: Christmas shopping! Literally went shopping three separate days and bought a singular item each time. 
                It's a lose-lose: if you give a bad gift, they won't use it and you waste money. If they give a bad gift, you pretend you like it and never use it, then feel guilty. Waaaay too much pressure here. My gift? We agree to not exchange gifts. THAT would be what I want.   </p>
        <h3>   12/19/25 Friday  </h3>                                                 <img alt="chicken crossing the road!" src="/blogphotos/riskblog.jpg"  style="float:right;width:85px;height:80px;">

            <p>Risk all day. If I only I could cash in my cards to fortify Asia, I could have defended the Middle East and maintained the 7 troop bonus. Luckily we kept our cool going through like 20 episodes of Spongebob on Nicktoons in the background.</p> 

            <h3>   12/17/25 Wednesday   </h3>
            <p>CRAZIEST thing happened today: 
                                        <img alt="chicken crossing the road!" src="/blogphotos/chickencrossroad.jpg"  style="float:right;width:150px;height:140px;">
was walking down Bleeker to go to Commons for three hours and saw a CHICKEN CROSSING THE ROAD. I kid you not. And no, I do not know why it decided to cross the road, but I think it knew it was going to make my day, so I appreciate it Mrs. Chicken. Drove home with Jack later, yet ended up on the least efficient route after taking the GWB, then Throgs, then missed turns, then apparently a hovering plane, and several other interesting instances that led us to drive through Manhattan. Took over 5 hours but this had to happen so we'd never make this mistake again. Not coping. I promise..... Still crazy about this chicken thing.  </p>
        <h3> 12/16/25 Tuesday </h3>
            <p>Today was the most productive day yet! Woke up and went to Commons until 3pm, 
then went to CBIS for 5 hours, then went back to Commons, then we came home to see milk at the door! Wierd thing about today: Industry Baby has been the stim song of the day. It holds up and highly recommend giving it a listen. <i>ANYWAY</i> really gotta pack to go home now, Jack and I have quite the journey to LI tomorrow, and before you leave check out my new Word list page (must find it)!  </p>
                        <img alt="milk" src="/blogphotos/milkatdoor.jpg"  style="float:right;width:140px;height:170px;">

            P.S. Working on a comment section for this blog/some user interaction. Surely this statement will age well.
        <h3>12/15/25 Monday</h3>
            <p>So SOME people have been talking about how I haven't been updating the blog, so here I am. Today at Commons there was this Heath hot chocolate that everyone agreed was life changing. We now live in a post-hot chocolate world. Welp. Maura just spilled all her root beer onto the table. Oh, wait it's not even all, she is still drinking the remainding root beet from her cup. This is like the sixth time she has spilled soda on technology, actually amazing. </p>
        <h3>12/11/25 Thursday</h3>
            <p>Blog #2. Today was the heat transfer final! It was happily pretty sleeper, but the last thing for this semester is sadly the entire URP research paper. U-238 photofission done, 3 more sections to go. Adrian recommended a comments section for this blog which I think would be really funny, so if that can work out I think it'd be necessary. If not, a donation page like the Integral Calculator guy would work. Please, buy me a coffee. Just a struggling nuclear engineer here. </p>
 
        <h3>12/10/25 Wednesday</h3>
            <p>This is my first blog test! The website is coming
                 along swimmingly, and I have my heat transfer final tomorrow. 
                 Sitting here at the table instead of studying... 
                 After that gotta do my entire URP research paper for radioxenon production uh oh. Hyper Thursday incoming. (Wow what a historic moment this is! Hello to whoever scrolled all the way down!)</p>
