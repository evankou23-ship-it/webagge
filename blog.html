            <p>Risk all day. If I only I could cash in my cards to fortify Asia, I could have defended the Middle East and maintained the 7 troop bonus. Luckily we kept our cool going through like 20 episodes of Spongebob on Nicktoons in the background.</p> 

            <h3>   12/17/25 Wednesday   </h3>
            <p>CRAZIEST thing happened today: 
                                        <img alt="chicken crossing the road!" src="/blogphotos/chickencrossroad.jpg"  style="float:right;width:150px;height:140px;">
was walking down Bleeker to go to Commons for three hours and saw a CHICKEN CROSSING THE ROAD. I kid you not. And no, I do not know why it decided to cross the road, but I think it knew it was going to make my day, so I appreciate it Mrs. Chicken. Drove home with Jack later, yet ended up on the least efficient route after taking the GWB, then Throgs, then missed turns, then apparently a hovering plane, and several other interesting instances that led us to drive through Manhattan. Took over 5 hours but this had to happen so we'd never make this mistake again. Not coping. I promise..... Still crazy about this chicken thing.  </p>
        <h3> 12/16/25 Tuesday </h3>
            <p>Today was the most productive day yet! Woke up and went to Commons until 3pm, 
then went to CBIS for 5 hours, then went back to Commons, then we came home to see milk at the door! Wierd thing about today: Industry Baby has been the stim song of the day. It holds up and highly recommend giving it a listen. <i>ANYWAY</i> really gotta pack to go home now, Jack and I have quite the journey to LI tomorrow, and before you leave check out my new Word list page (must find it)!  </p>

            P.S. Working on a comment section for this blog/some user interaction. Surely this statement will age well.
        <h3>12/15/25 Monday</h3>
            <p>So SOME people have been talking about how I haven't been updating the blog, so here I am. Today at Commons there was this Heath hot chocolate that everyone agreed was life changing. We now live in a post-hot chocolate world. Welp. Maura just spilled all her root beer onto the table. Oh, wait it's not even all, she is still drinking the remainding root beet from her cup. This is like the sixth time she has spilled soda on technology, actually amazing. </p>
        <h3>12/11/25 Thursday</h3>
            <p>Blog #2. Today was the heat transfer final! It was happily pretty sleeper, but the last thing for this semester is sadly the entire URP research paper. U-238 photofission done, 3 more sections to go. Adrian recommended a comments section for this blog which I think would be really funny, so if that can work out I think it'd be necessary. If not, a donation page like the Integral Calculator guy would work. Please, buy me a coffee. Just a struggling nuclear engineer here. </p>
 
        <h3>12/10/25 Wednesday</h3>
            <p>This is my first blog test! The website is coming
                 along swimmingly, and I have my heat transfer final tomorrow. 
                 Sitting here at the table instead of studying... 
                 After that gotta do my entire URP research paper for radioxenon production uh oh. Hyper Thursday incoming. (Wow what a historic moment this is! Hello to whoever scrolled all the way down!)</p>
