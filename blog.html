         <h3>  2/16/26 Monday   </h3>
            <p>No school today, and pretty much stayed in the Union. But I am pleased to announce I am back into a Star Wars phase, of which I was last in from 2011 to 2013. After watching the prequels in one day last semester, then the Force Awakens yesterday, I understand this on a whole new level. And yea, the sequels have many problems, but I am approaching the rewatch with an open mind. I think something well done by the sequels is the music -- keeping John Williams made sure not all the original charm was lost, and he definitely implimented some bangers, like Rey's Theme, and Han and Leia reprises and whatnot. As you might expect, genre of the week is Star Wars now. 
                <p>On a lighter note, I think I'm eating really terribly these past few days. Like no salads could balance this out. The second I entered my house to come home for the winter, my grandma told me how skinny I looked, so it's time to prove her wrong. </p>
         <h3> 2/14/26 Saturday    </h3></h3>
            <p>Somehow another one of those days. Awoke at 7am and went to DCC in the morn for a day of Exploring Engineerings. But I was not the explorer, but rather, the map...? Idk but a buncha kids came to campus and we gave a little presentation on nuclear power plants, and it was really cool. The first group of kids had absolutely crazy loaded questions about storing nuclear waste, and we had to really weave around that one. Another kid asked why heavy isotopes don't fission instantly, so we all sat him down and explain all of quantum physics and potential wells with half lives as probabalistic measures. <img alt="Kyle O'Connor!" src="/blogphotos/Troymusichall.jpg"  style="float:right;width:290px;height:200px;">Alright not really but it would have been funny. In some groups, there were parent chaperones bringing them around, and when I answered that question, this goateed dude in the back was kinda smirking and looking fake-surprished the whole time we presented. So at the end, he came down to me and was like good job guys; turns out he worked in energy for years as was kinda messing with us which was funny. Another lady was with another group and she was staring at her iPad the whole time. I was thinking well what the hell, but it turns out she worked at freaking Naval Nuclear Labs, so I was like welp. 
                I cannot imagine the restraint it must have taken her to not chime in after every slide or part of the activity that we did, but she was a really good sport. The whole day was like an entire EA school visit, but at RPI, and about nuclear, so super cool! Afterward, P brought back some sandwiches from Garafalos to enjoy in the Union, and it tasted like the NMP break room. Takes you back.<p>After this, it was time to head to Troy Music Hall for the Albany Symphony. It is such a phenomenal building, and had no idea that so many famous people played in this building. If you're in the area, I HIGHLY recommend attending something there. We were dressed primly, and blended into high society that night. I think the average age in the building was 73, but it was well-worth hear some Tschai and a world premier of an upcoming composer's works. We were the standing ovation. </p>
            </p>
         <h3>  2/13/26 Friday </h3><img alt="Kyle O'Connor!" src="/blogphotos/kyleoc.jpg"  style="float:right;width:250px;height:200px;">
            <p>Do you ever have those days where you wake up and know it's gonna be a looong day ahead of you? Definitely today. Awoke very well rested, knowing what was ahead. Had a moment of respite at Sage breakfast, then it was time for Nump Comp exam. Somehow, Lvov was the most normal he had been all semester; no playing games today. Right after, it was time hit CBIS for an interview (classic spot, HIGHLY recommend. But if you see me there you better scram). After that, had meal in Sage with Maddie, and ranted about said interview, to which it was time to head to the women's game, where we absolutely crushed Harvard 4-1. Baaaad day to be a Harvard fan there. Staying in the Field House, the men's game against Cornell was about to start, and Kyle O'Connor was coming with his band! On top of that, Katie and I got wristbands to go into the Pride Suite(?) for Phalanx and, not gonna lie, felt really cool. Thus began the second half of the day.<p>
                Cornell is like 9th in the nation, so walking over to Kyle we both agreed that it would be at least interesting if RPI scored one goal. Boy were we not expecting this. For the first time in months, the Engineers looked AMAZING on the ice. Both teams held their own for the entire first period, until it was time for me to go on the ice! Surprise! I got to see the inside of where the players go, and wow it smelled so bad. Understandable cause they were sweating on the ice there, like wow. Nevertheless, got to wave to the fans at center ice, and yada-yada. Afterward I went to the Cornell band to say hi to Kyle, and it was a fun perspective. Who knew they had some bangers, but I left promptly because I didn't wanna be there when Cornell scored the first goal. So after retuning back to RPI band, I look up, and RPI SCORED FIRST!!! OMGGG!!! It was a frenzy in the Field House, and MANY MANY sad Cornell fans as they took the L. I have no idea 
                what team that was, but they were embarassing Cornell big time. After a super band, and a third period where Cornell scored again, overtime was scary. I nearly vomited and collapsed on Chloe. But then... it was over... we had tied with Cornell. Sure, they won the shootout, but it is rare that a game changed your outlook on life. Truly anything must be possible if that can happen. I almost believe in miracles, and if that team shows up to Freakout, I think we have a chance. Please let that age well. </p>
         <h3>   2/11/26 Wednesday </h3>
            <p>Woke up at like 7:30 this morning, and felt great. Except it was kind of insulting by my body because LINAC was cancelled today as Danon was on travel, so quite literally had zero obligations. Well that's not true but you get the point. I was so stubborn that even though I felt so refreshed I forced myself to stay in bed until I eventually fell back asleep after like 40 min and awoke at 10:15. Now that is sleeping in. Still had Danon's Geiger on my desk, so I drove to the LINAC anyway to return it, and turns out there's a little doorbell on the door that I never noticed. I rang it and some worker took it from my hands.
                 I never noticed how slowly four hours pass by when you're not in lab; I got to spend the day at the Union doing MCNP, but more importantly Burger Bears!! It was a very pleasant time of the day with Arthur, McKenna, and Alexis in Commons eating some nice borger. <p>Genre of the week is Fabloo, so got to listen to some nice Tally Hall/Miracle Musical and They Might Be Giants, some classics of past years. Favorite songs right now are Two Wuv / Black Rainbows and The Mesopatamians, respectively. While running MCNP today, Alexis won the Package Game! Photo is included. Also sorry for missing yesterday's blog, I have to use VS Code to run Python now instead of Spyder, and it kinda gets in the way sometimes. Alas. Oh also check the leaderboards on Pitbull Party just had an >12 hr party. Yea. </p> </p>
        <h3>   2/9/26 Monday</h3>
            <p>So I was trying to get this Python script for ARA to work all day, so after 6 hours of classes I go to JEC to the TA office hours and find the little room and sure enough the TA was in there to help. Of course I was very thankful cause I had no idea what the problem was, but I had the script open in VS Code and everytime I hit run it threw an error. Except VS Code also happens to be the same software I make this website in... so he kinda asked what all these files were and I kinda just had to explain what he was looking at and what the bright blue page that said <b>Blog</b> was. Fun fact, part of the problem was that the entire <a href="https://webagge.vercel.app/">webagge.vercel.app</a> folder was opened in VS Code which prevented the nuclear code was running so he had to manually close each file and ask "can I delete this one?" to each one. Not sure if I would have preferred at least
            one other person in the room with me or not. But you know what, he ended up solving the problems after like 40 minutes, so shoutout to TA Jose. It's this core design thing where you move around assemblies and you actually feel so cool working on it. Very engineer. <p>Anyway, still waiting to hear back from Los Alamos. But I realized that a summer at Three Mile Island (Crane, in case you're reading this Constellation) would also be extremely cool since they are restarting. So the backup plan is honestly not that bad, but sadly being the middle of the New Mexico desert during the summer might just be the coolest thing ever perhaps. Ugh that would be aweomse. Weird to still have no idea how this will pan out, considering this summer is without a doubt a major trajectory in my education then career then where I spend my life. No biggie. <p>Dang it I'm kinda sleeplocked until the dryer finishes. I swear the dryer in this house takes three hours, pretty sure I put it in at 9 pm and it is currently 11:32 pm. Ooh but then the pajamas will be nice and warm. Alright maybe it's not so bad. </p> </p>  </p>
        <h3>   2/7/26 Sunday/Saturday </h3>
            <p>So you know how 2000s R&B was the genre of the week? Well all that Pitbull came to a climax upon going to Colgate for the hockey game. I guess their team likes Pitbull cause he was like half the warm-up songs. Was was crazy was the song from <a href="http://www.pitbullparty.com/">Pitbull Party</a> came on and I activated like a sleeper agent. Sadly no one else plays PP there so it was like an insane joke with myself, and sometimes you gotta have those. <p>Also had an interesting thought discussed: when is somebody "in town?" Like if I travel to NYC from Troy, would I tell my friends on the island that I'm "in town?" Perhaps. But if you travel from LI to the city, you are surely leaving town, right? Maybe all this depends on your starting point. So how long should you travel from your starting point before you've "left town?" Doing MCNP all day but then Super Bowl LX with Buff dip! Wow that looks really cool in roman numerals. Go Seahawks.</p>   </p>
        <h3>   2/5/26 Thursday </h3>
            Hi vlog. Actually, wrong. Factally not a vlog. Simply a blog. But I, Evan Koumas, commonly refer to it as a vlog. Today, pretty
        simple day. Woke up, put on flannel, went to brekkie. Maura arrived at exactly 9:49 am to Sage Dining Hall. I heard she's trying to set the record of cutting it the closest to missing breakfast, but neither here nor there. Then, attended class. Arrived to Panera for lunch. Nothing crazy. Blueberry lemonade and "one of those frozen signature hot chocolates. It's been killing my flex, but so worth. I got it that day they were doing $2 off deal and have gotten it every day since. Skipped the weekend though. It's simply a milkshake though. I hate that [slurpy sound] that occurs when you get to the end of the shake." Not a fan. Pretty yucky. Not as yucky as Union College though. Canonically the yuckiest.
        <p>
            Class of 2026 100 days 'til graduation celebration. Line too long though. I'm also not in that class, but it's cool. Will be me next year. Then I ran MCNP for a while in the Stu-Un while cracking open a nice, ice cold Pepsi from an undisclosed source (certainly not a friend in the class of '26.) Fathomed a non-existent box for LINAC lab with Fritz. Said non-existent box exists in the EVU (Endless Void Universe). New acronym dropping soon. Stay safe, and sleep tight. Hope you've enjoyed the consistent blogging recently.

        <h3>   2/4/26 Wednesday </h3>
            <p>Lvov is wild. Constantly in shambles, but half of everything he says McKenna and I just look at each other like wtf. So there is an exam on the 13th, which unfortunately coincides with an EA visit. The following is an approximate conversation between us after class after I tell him my situation (note he speaks in a very very thick Russian accent.)<br><br>"So could you take the exam at 9am then?"<br>"No, my EA visit is all day."<br>"So could you take the exam at 7am then?"<br>"No, my EA visit is all day, which includes the morning." <br>"But.... could you take the exam at 5am?"<br><br>
                I was about to say no but I actually had to stop for a second after physically being stunned and think about it. Genuinely I could do this, and would be a reaaaallly funny bit. Worth whatever grade I get honestly. Turns out if that was the case, the exam would have to be taken virtually, which I am not about and feels a little slimy. Like if other people took a virtual exam while I took a real one I wouldn't like that maybe. We genuinely ended up having an email conversation about this idea today and his emails are written exactly in his demeanor: all lowercase, short sentences; it is very sweet. I genuinely appreciate his committment to this bit so no shade or anything. On a completely unrelated note, I had to get up and blow my nose like 8 times during Linac lab today, like that is so embarassing. I mean don't wanna do it in the room but it's kind of <abbr title="Bad Manners">BM</abbr> to do it in the room repeatedly. Anyway missing Borger Wednesday this semester cause of Linac and it's been getting me down, you know. We'll be looking into that.    </p>
        <h3>  2/3/26  Tuesday </h3>
            <p>Sitting here running MCNP in Sharp. We've got two computers going and three files -- LWR fuel pin in water, LWR fuel pin in sodium, and a TRISO fuel. Today I drove P to Albany to take his Plant Operation Selection (POS) Test and he passed! P is gonna be an operator soon (hopefully)! Nothing else much to say. </p>
        <h3>   2/2/26  Monday</h3><img alt="My geigers on the kitchen table." src="/blogphotos/Geigers.jpg"  style="float:right;width:100px;height:100px;">
            <p>Mat Sci with freshman is sooo funny. Yet somehow I've found like the 3 or 4 other upperclassmen in the section and we formed the most overqualified lab group today. Got the whole thing done in like 20 minutes. Anyway the 2000s R&B genre of the week has been popping off. Never realized Desnity's Child had so many bangers. My favorites are Bills, Bills, Bills, So Good, and Lose My Breath with that insane marching cadence throughout, which makes for a nasty beatbox too. It's also Groundhog Day, and I must say I did not feel much of the rodent spirit today. I think we're looking into that. OOh I made my own Minute Cryptic today in ARA. Here it is:<br><br><b>"You'd know why!" after entrance of lively forte (4)</b> <br><br>Please <a href="mailto:evankou23@gmail.com">email</a>
 me (link also on homepage) if you think you know the answer. I'll send my answer video if you provide a guess. On another note, I walked home today with a Geiger counter and survey reader from Maddie's car. Praying that I can get them to work before Union after dark (come to SNAG table if cool). One last thought -- if both your nostrils are clear right now, take a moment to appreciate it. One will be clogged again eventually, so enjoy and take 10 seconds right now savor this moment. There you go. It's good to be appreciative of the small things.  </p>
        <h3>  1/31/26 Saturday   </h3>
            <p>Day with much content. Craziest part was leaving between hockey games with Jack for a mission to Walmart. Jack since you're reading this, you can be like "yea, I was there" to anyone else who's in the room with you right now. Well I'll relay what happened and you can fact-check to make sure we're all square. So at Pepsgiving Mike D. and I joked it would be funny if one of these games we had an entire rotisserie chicken and just ate it in the stands. I really wanted to commit to this bit, so after waiting for the right day, it was time. The band had a women's then club hockey game to attend with about 1.5 hr between. With the women's game ending at ~5pm, we had to be back in the Field House by 6:30pm -- perfect day for a chicken. So Jack and I left for Walmart, but about halfway there, I realized I forgot my wallet, including my license, which is awfully bad ("hardcore mode"). I told Jack I'd pay him back, and we were almost at Aldi's, our first stop, so we just kept going. Turn out Aldi's had no <abbr title="Rotisserie chicken">ROTC</abbr>, so it was off to Walmart. We arrived and immediately found their pantheon of <abbr title="Rotisserie chicken">ROTC</abbr>. Except it was literally 5:47 so we had a lot of time to kill. That said, we put the <abbr title="Rotisserie chicken">ROTC</abbr> down, 
                and started a lap around Troy Walmart, passing through the rest of grocery, pet products, until we came across the tech department. We stumbled across this kiosk that advertised custom prints on things like plushes, cards, even wrapping paper but like for 40 dollars. We were curious about the cheapest thing on there, and we found you can make a custom magnet for THREE DOLLARS. What a steal. At three dollars and time to kill, I mean you might as well try it out. So I connected my phone and uploaded <a href="pictures/theband2025.jpg">this image</a> and sure enough it accepted it, but then it told us it would end...at 6:55pm, sending auto texts to Jack's phone like "Make sure not to drive over yet, we'll text you when we're done!😊👍" Welp. We were stuck in Walmart until then. Then we thought about it and surely nobody else was making a magnet right now, and no way it would take an hour to finish. So we continued walking around the store, avoiding loitering and accumulating a box of donuts, a Needo toy on clearance, and an OLIPOP cream soda. Then in just 15 or so we decided to check on the tech center with the magnet, and it turns out it was perfect timing! The guy was putting it in an envelope, he offered to check out the rest of our items at the tech center. Turns out tap did not work at Walmart and after all of that, we could not pay for our items...<p><p>
                    The guy unscanned our items after we promised we'd be back and we racked our brains for possible solutions. The Walmart app didnt work, and I legitimately thought about Zelling the cashier then he could pay for it out of his own pocket, I didn't tell Jack that. Nonetheless, we prayed that Sam Trombone who had a car was still at the Field House, so in a no-questions-asked situation I called him to go into my backpack in the Field House and deliver my wallet to Walmart. As the absolute saint he is, Sam Trombone pulled through and shortly afterward, I was reunited with my wallet. The items were scanned again, I paid with my very adult debit card, and we left Walmart with two ROTCs in hand excited to share with the band. 
                </p> </p> 
        <h3>    1/28/26 Wednesday </h3>    <img alt="My dosimeter." src="/blogphotos/dosimeter.jpg"  style="float:right;width:100px;height:100px;">
            <p>Time to nerd out today: did some cool stuff at the LINAC like neutron detection, except I lowkey did nothing but watch. P held the Cf source way above his head which was really funny when Danon called him over to use his services after he volunteered to do everything last class. He'll be such a great operator. Sadly I couldn't take a photo unless it was cleared by the RSO, but I think I can show you my dosimeter if the bar code is blurred so here you go. A little different than the one from Nine Mile, given it's clipped to your shirt rather than and lanyard, and also you can't take it home to put it in the microwave. Very understandable. During class we all just kinda talked with Danon the whole time, and he mentioned this site called <a href="https://notebooklm.google/">Notebook LM</a> from Google. It's an isolated large language model, and he relayed this story about
                how when plugged the PNR notes into this LLM, it could generate a PODCAST on a specific chapter between a man and a woman talking. According to him listening to it, the podcast touched on all the main points he wants his PNR students to know, and he just found it funny, not even scary. He said to try it out after class, so indeed I did. I took one of our ARA readings, simply inputted it, and after 5 or so minutes it had an entire 16 minute podcast of disemboided voices talking to each other about resonance integrals and how we solve trillions of unknowns. I recommend giving it a shot simply because a very traditional professor thought this was funny which it honestly is. I liked your responses to the last homework, so please email me about a podcast you make! </p>
        <h3>  1/27/26 Tuesday   </h3>                                <img alt="A car buried in snow." src="/blogphotos/carinsnow.jpg"  style="float:right;width:150px;height:130px;">

            <p>Back to reality... But actually not really cause it's still wild outside. Walking to breakfast this morning and there were cars completely covered with only the windshield wipers to imply any semblance of an automobile. Got some work done but later went down to J to check on my car that I left there after Mayor's Cup. Luckily, not as bad as the picture of that car. I found a nearby shovel and started clearing it, but then a Pubsafe officer walked out of J and asked what I was doing (again?!) to which I answered honestly. To my surprise he told me to sit tight and he walked to his car and came back with a snowbrush to help me out! We cleared out my car enough to possibly drive to the LINAC tomorrow, so huge shoutout to Officer Manny for helping me out.
                <br>
                <br>
                On another note, Zachtronics got back to me about the Shenzhen cards!!! Although his response was just...a little unenthusiastic. I told him I'm a huge fan of the game, the solitaire, and that I'm an RPI student just like he was, but all he emailed back were a couple of <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=mhing+game">Ebay links</a> of cards from a game called Mhing. The thing is, they don't really look exactly like the in-game cards, so I fear creating a custom deck is the only way to go. Although I must say, I truly appreciate getting a response from an alum as successful as he is, and I understood the brevity of the email. His company has a wikipedia page and his email is literally @zachtronics.com, so I feel like he knows what's up. Well our first actual lab in LINAC lab is tomorrow, so I'll update you guys on how that goes tomorrow. 
            </p>
        <h3>   1/26/26 SNOW DAY!!!  </h3>                        <img alt="Highland Ave after Winter Storm 2026" src="/blogphotos/snow2026.jpg"  style="float:right;width:150px;height:130px;">

            <p>Alright so technically not a Snow Day but this is the closest we'll get In-person classes were legally cancelled, so they were forced to be held online which honestly I'll take it. Now Applied Reactor Analysis was straight cancelled, so we'll return on Thursday going three weeks into the semester and had only gone to class twice... Snow is coming down steady today, and the results are crazy. The image from outside does not give it justice -- it is almost apocalyptic. Arthur and I agree, it might just be the most snow from one storm we've seen in our lives. Had this thought the other day: it'd be crazy if all the snow fell at once.  </p>
            <h3>    1/25/26 Sunday </h3>
            <p>Today was Day 1 of the Winter Storm 2026. It's cool when the talk of the town for the past few days is this big storm that's going to happen, then when it actually does happen it is simply bonkers. We were talking about this yesterday, but how did people in like 1900 know if there was going to be a massive blizzard? Simply they did not. 
                Maybe they get letters from their friends in the North where the storm hit first, but that's all they could do, right? Suddenly it started snowing then boom it's a blizzard. I think they'd have no idea when it would stop snowing and it would just stink. Today the snow started atound 11am and even 5 hours in by 4pm it was already nearing a foot. This was just 5 hrs out of the over 24 hour snowfall. Just imagine you're a peasant in the Victorian Era wondering when will this blasted winter end, and you just have no idea.
                <br>
                <br>
                On another note, played Bridge with some of the Nukes today and it is so much thinking and strategy, nearly cannot fathom. We have the basics down but keeping track of points is by far the hardest part to learn. You get points for each trick over 6, depending on trump suit, but no trump gets you extra but only for first trick over 6, but below the contract it's a greater penalty, and if your team has vulnerable status it's actually a GREATER penalty, 
                and you getter hope it's not doubled, oh but if one of those special game contracts you get more bonus points. I feel like we discovered a brand new really niche rule every game for scoring, and I just think it'd be so funny to get really good at Bridge. 
            </p>
        <h3>   1/24/26 Saturday  </h3>
            <p>Pretty sure this whole day will be documented on another page in the website. There's something about spending an entire day watching very intense hockey. It's a shared experience with only the people in that stadium; I really enjoy those "you had to be there" scenarios a lot." Sometimes it's impossible to understand something from another's POV unless you have had the exact same experiences as that other person; you just have no way of knowing. Anyway definitely just coping right now. Went to Vermont and Mass today too. </p>
        <h3>   1/22/26 Thursday  </h3>
            <p>Rabbit hole of the week: RPI website on the Wayback Machine. Go to my misc links to explore yourself, cause there are so many tiny litte details of early Internet that you simply never get anymore, a literal time capsule of 30 years ago. It's weird 30 years ago feels like a long time, but the Internet was alive and thriving, and websites were popping up everywhere. This whole thing even inspired me to start this site, and it why you're reading this right now. One of these details is that very often you come across directions to get places. If people wanted to meet somewhere, you simply had to know where to go, so websites had directions like taking exits off highways or driving through freeways and taking a left at this or that landmark. Obvsiously it's not weird, but it kind of it to think that these were the college days of people just like us who were literally the same people with the same humor. In fact I guarentee that the college students of 2056 reading this are like "man, I can't believe everyone had Instagram profiles to showcase their whole life that's crazy!" Yet here we are. Anyway, go to my <a href="Links.html">Links</a> page to check this out and explore to your heart's content. Your homework is to email me about anything you find interesting, I will definitely find it cool too! That's it for today, so see you tomorrow. </p>
        <h3>   1/21/26 Wednesday  </h3>
            <p>It feels like last week was a month ago. So much happened in between since last Wednesday that the entirety of break feels like about a week. Anyway, Commons had these homemade Twix bars as an ST (see <a href="wordlist.html">initialisms</a>) and it was divine. Anyway, always something happening with LINAC lab, and while we there, P made his 2026th <a href="Links.html">Shenzhen.io Solitaire</a> win, and can no longer play until 2027. We also started using this new Monte Carlo called SRIM for ions that looks like it was made the same year as this website looks like it was made. It's public software so I can show it here, and it is simply amazing. Also you can't change the aspect ratio/fullscreen; it's stuck at a charming postage stamp size. But we love nuclear code. <img alt="SRIM interface. You can't make this up." src="/blogphotos/srim.png"  style="float:right;width:180px;height:160px;">            
                
                <br>
                <br>
                Alright back to Shenzhen. So you remember how the original game was made by an RPI alum and we flipped out? Well during dinner we were curious...could we get our hands on a real life Shenzhen deck? I was certain. To do this, we'd need the actual textures from the game for accuracy, so who else to ask but Zachtronics himself, creator of Shenzhen.io and Infiniminer (original predecessor to Minecraft), and RPI class of '08? So, I contacted him using school email to see what he can do, promising a copy of the deck if I can make it happen, BCCing Bob and Maddie as to include them but not scare off Zachtronics with all this pressure. Probably the first use of BCC this year. That said, can only pray to hear what he makes of this, so stay tuned for Zachtronics updates!  </p>

        <p>Hey Friendships, I heard about my lack of blogging recently, and first I'd like to apologize. I think I just closed my Visual Studio Code app which is usually in my taskbar to remind my update the blog every day. Well boy do I have quite the story: so yesterday Maddie, P, and I visited Saratoga for the bit, and we first tried the many water springs they've. I don't want to spoil the experience but you'll definitely know which one is the best out of the 6 or so. Interestingly, many of these springs have dissolved iron which give it this disgusting <i>tufa</i> around it. Yuck. Anyway, they also had a little fire going so you could roast some marshmallows on the snowy afternoon and warm your hands. Hmm I think it's time to make another paragraph.  
            <br>
            <br>
            So we get to town and explore the shops including a very quaint bookstore, probably best one I've ever been in terms of vibes. We then come to a crossroads: P enters a cigar store draped with American flags -- probably the most conservative room I've ever witnessed. Maddie and I enter this nutty crystal/astrology shop being the most liberal room ever witnessed. I asked about any rocks with uranium just to test their limits but they didn't seem to like that. In the back there were some real nutty books, and they asked where we were from we just said Troy as to not blow our cover completely. I declined to be "read" whatever that means and we promptly booked it. 
            We ate at Bailey's Cafe, but we were not prepared for our next destination: what seemed to be thrift store was actually a confinement store with clothing cramped so close like a Minecraft base with one block wide hallways and two block tall roof. It is in a basement, and as you enter down from stairs from the street, clothing racks covered everything. When we were the ready to leave, the kind lady thanked us for coming, and asked where we were from. Again, we just say Troy, to which she responds by stating she just read an article saying that's in the top 10 worst places in NY to live. Well alright, thanks lady. She continues going on about how some places are nicer than others, such as Russia. We kinda wanna see where she's going with this so we sorta get her to keep talking until she's on about how Ukraine is not a real country and that Russia will take what's rightfully theirs. All we can do is just nod politely like mm yep mm yep. THEN she gets quiet and says, "you know what, something BIG is gonna happen tomorrow..." "Huh? What are you talking about?" "I'm not saying anything else...but something big..." We all looked at each other like yep, that's our cue, and politely exited, all looking wide-eyed like what the hell did we just witness. 
            <br>
            <br>
            That brings us to today, where we've all been on the lookout for "something big." The annoything is that ANYTHING could happen and she'd be right. There is only half hour left of the day, and if nothing happens, P and I decided we're driving back to Saratoga to ask what the hell she was on about. Then, I'm sure New York State Fire Code would like to have a chat with her. Well seems like a proper length for a blog post. Expect more. Thanks again for the emails, I really do appreciate them.

        <h3>   1/13/26 Tuesday </h3>
            <p>Welcome to Spring 26! It's been great to be back for two days, and finally be mentally stimulated again. Every class, even freshman MatSci was the most interesting thing ever compared to most of the last three weeks. Infinite Minecraft and TV must come to an end, and with no more loose ends from the winter break, it's back to grind time. </p>
        <h3>    1/7/26 Wednesday </h3>
            <p>Whoa... I feel like it's been a while. LOTS have happened so far: watched SO much tv, played SO much Minecraft, and actually painted some things. No but honestly, I don't think anyone else on Earth has watched six hours of Severance into six hours of The Odd Couple in one day all after metagaming the<abbr title="Minecraft Card Game"> MCCG</abbr>, pretty sure I got that record on lock. </p>

Heading to the city today, we had to find a way to fill the void between Christmas and New Years "NYE" Eve. That initialism is so dumb; I mean who says those letter out loud anyway? 
                Should add that on <a href="wordlist.html" >my least favorite word list</a>. Getting ahead of ourselves huh. You really understand museums a lot more going back when you're consious. Seeing all these toddlers at the AMNH made me wonder how many of them really appreciate what they're looking at? 
Sure the hanging whale and diaramas are amazing, but there was one small thing that oddly stuck out to me this time around: in the African exhibit there was a one-off glass display case housing various artifacts, and one of them was this ivory tusk, carved away intricately to show a snake spiraling around the tusk. Along the snake lay figures of people doing various activities, all carved by hand and preserved for so long. There is no way a snotty 7 year old me would have appreciated that! Yet I figured the value me coming here so long ago was being able to remember the big parts of it, and feel nostalgic coming back all these years later. That said, it was enlightening going back with friends who could also appreciate the exhibits. With the city being super packed around this time, we hopped back on the LIRR and booked it by the evening after taking some great Where's Waldo among the crowds.  </p>
        <h3>  12/26/25 Thursday🎄  </h3>
            <p>Winter break Me has gone too far. Apparently he doesn't care about sleep at all, that upon staying up until 3 am, he was like "you know what? no sleep for you." Stayed consious in bed until the birds started chirping into Christmas Eve and I arose an mixture between sleepy and awake, a sleepwalking semi-awake lethargic abomination. Like why's that gotta happen?? Then had to endure Christmanukah going into 40 hours awake (although very yummy food) until finally I was allowed to sleep. Pretty messed up, huh. Anyway Christmas was cool, the Chinese food was great, and watched 12 Angry Men for some reason today (very good film, original of course). Very hard to come across new and exciting thoughts these days, but we'll get back to it. </p>
        <h3>  12/23/25 Tuesday?   </h3>
            <p>Winter break Me has officially taken over, and there are still two weeks left for him to reign. He makes me get up past 10 am, go to sleep past 2 am, and I fear it will only get more extreme the more Minecraft there is to play. He warps my sense of time, where I'm pretty sure last time I did actual work was 3 months ago but it was probably like 1.5 weeks ago. Wait wasn't the Fluids final today?? Poor Mane students still at RPI. Also figured out at least top 3 worst activity these past days: Christmas shopping! Literally went shopping three separate days and bought a singular item each time. 
                It's a lose-lose: if you give a bad gift, they won't use it and you waste money. If they give a bad gift, you pretend you like it and never use it, then feel guilty. Waaaay too much pressure here. My gift? We agree to not exchange gifts. THAT would be what I want.   </p>
        <h3>   12/19/25 Friday  </h3>                                                 <img alt="chicken crossing the road!" src="/blogphotos/riskblog.jpg"  style="float:right;width:85px;height:80px;">

            <p>Risk all day. If I only I could cash in my cards to fortify Asia, I could have defended the Middle East and maintained the 7 troop bonus. Luckily we kept our cool going through like 20 episodes of Spongebob on Nicktoons in the background.</p> 

            <h3>   12/17/25 Wednesday   </h3>
            <p>CRAZIEST thing happened today: 
                                        <img alt="chicken crossing the road!" src="/blogphotos/chickencrossroad.jpg"  style="float:right;width:150px;height:140px;">
was walking down Bleeker to go to Commons for three hours and saw a CHICKEN CROSSING THE ROAD. I kid you not. And no, I do not know why it decided to cross the road, but I think it knew it was going to make my day, so I appreciate it Mrs. Chicken. Drove home with Jack later, yet ended up on the least efficient route after taking the GWB, then Throgs, then missed turns, then apparently a hovering plane, and several other interesting instances that led us to drive through Manhattan. Took over 5 hours but this had to happen so we'd never make this mistake again. Not coping. I promise..... Still crazy about this chicken thing.  </p>
        <h3> 12/16/25 Tuesday </h3>
            <p>Today was the most productive day yet! Woke up and went to Commons until 3pm, 
then went to CBIS for 5 hours, then went back to Commons, then we came home to see milk at the door! Wierd thing about today: Industry Baby has been the stim song of the day. It holds up and highly recommend giving it a listen. <i>ANYWAY</i> really gotta pack to go home now, Jack and I have quite the journey to LI tomorrow, and before you leave check out my new Word list page (must find it)!  </p>
                        <img alt="milk" src="/blogphotos/milkatdoor.jpg"  style="float:right;width:140px;height:170px;">

            P.S. Working on a comment section for this blog/some user interaction. Surely this statement will age well.
        <h3>12/15/25 Monday</h3>
            <p>So SOME people have been talking about how I haven't been updating the blog, so here I am. Today at Commons there was this Heath hot chocolate that everyone agreed was life changing. We now live in a post-hot chocolate world. Welp. Maura just spilled all her root beer onto the table. Oh, wait it's not even all, she is still drinking the remainding root beet from her cup. This is like the sixth time she has spilled soda on technology, actually amazing. </p>
        <h3>12/11/25 Thursday</h3>
            <p>Blog #2. Today was the heat transfer final! It was happily pretty sleeper, but the last thing for this semester is sadly the entire URP research paper. U-238 photofission done, 3 more sections to go. Adrian recommended a comments section for this blog which I think would be really funny, so if that can work out I think it'd be necessary. If not, a donation page like the Integral Calculator guy would work. Please, buy me a coffee. Just a struggling nuclear engineer here. </p>
 
        <h3>12/10/25 Wednesday</h3>
            <p>This is my first blog test! The website is coming
                 along swimmingly, and I have my heat transfer final tomorrow. 
                 Sitting here at the table instead of studying... 
                 After that gotta do my entire URP research paper for radioxenon production uh oh. Hyper Thursday incoming. (Wow what a historic moment this is! Hello to whoever scrolled all the way down!)</p>
