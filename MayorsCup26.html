        <h1>Mayor's Cup 2026 (Jan 24)</h1>
        <h4>What a day here in the Capital Region: negative degrees but we come to the MVP Arena for two hockey games featuring our lovely Engineers and the yucky Union "Garnet" "Chargers."</h4>
        <p>We arrive early at the MVP arena, where we'll spend the next 7.5 hours of our lives. Classic speaker system blocking the Jumptron, but we'll let it slide with this bonkers view of the ice. [empty arena] </p></p>

        <p>Here come the women's team in our first game with absolutely fire Mayor's Cup jerseys representing Troy, NY. Alright I didn't get very close but here's a closeup from their website. Soooo cool. </p>

        <p>And here come the Union College starting lineups!</p>

        <p>Honestly friends, I don't know if I can finish this page in good faith after the results of the games. I'll need a week or so to cope. Instead, take this Banana split I got after the games since my Stewart's punch card was complete.</p>
