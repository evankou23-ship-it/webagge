        <h1 style="text-align: center">Some favorite things. </h1>
    
        <p><b>Favorite color?</b> Brown. Highly underrated shade with many deep and rich tones. </p>
        <img alt="Shades of brown" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Color_icon_brown_v2.svg">
         <p><b>Favorite music group/person?</b> It's Ween. Two of the most prodigiously talented music makers and they choose to make blues songs about spinal meningitis, and ordering Mexican food LoFi. Also a fan of like every genre. </p>

        <p><b>Favorite day of the week?</b> Hot take: Sunday. Look, weekends are nice and all and that's why Friday and Saturday are close behind. However the coziness and weekend-wind down you get from a nice Sunday is unmatched. The whimsy of Saturday would not exist without the humbleness and class of Sunday. </p>

        <p><b>Favorite dream job?</b> Circus ring leader. Imagine travelling in a caravan (with humanely treated animals) across continental America, pitching up your red and white striped tent in big field and waiting for the crowds to come and be wowed and amazed. "Ladies and gentleman" type of job.</p>
        <img alt="A tiny circus tent" src="https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/650000/nahled/image-1732514403Mcr.jpg" style="width:250px">
        <p><b>Favorite literary device?</b> Definitely the humble <a href="oxymorons.html">oxymoron.</a> UPDATE: Honorable mention is the dysphemism. It's like euphamism but it intentionally makes the phrase worse than better. See <a href="pictures/dyspem.png">THIS</a> for examples.

        <p><b>Favorite sitcom?</b> Seinfeld, possibly tied with HIMYM</p>
        <img alt="Seinfeld Season 9 DVD" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/90/Seinfeld9.jpg/250px-Seinfeld9.jpg">
        <p><b>Favorite word?</b> Apothecary. Little antiquated nowadays, but it is so fun to say. See <a href="wordlist.html">word list. </a></p>
        <img alt="An apothecary" src="https://d2cbg94ubxgsnp.cloudfront.net/Pictures/480x320fitpad[0]/3/7/2/539372_images_large_ed4c00925_0002_499910.jpeg" style="float:center;width:300px;height:200px;">

        <p><b>Favorite animal? </b>Tie: Giraffes are absolutely magnificient creatures, but I hope I live to see the day that there is recorded footage of a sperm whale vs giant squid. Colossal ocean titans battle it out, and all we've ever seen are tentacle imprints on whales and whale bites taken out of squid. They could be fighting right now under the ocean as you read this and we'll never know.</p>
