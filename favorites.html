        <h1 style="text-align: center">Some favorite things. </h1>
    
        <p><b>Favorite color?</b> Brown. Highly underrated shade with many deep and rich tones. </p>

         <p><b>Favorite music group/person?</b> It's Ween. Two of the most prodigiously talented music makers and they choose to make blues songs about spinal meningitis, and ordering Mexican food LoFi. Also a fan of like every genre. </p>

        <p><b>Favorite day of the week?</b> Hot take: Sunday. Look, weekends are nice and all and that's why Friday and Saturday are close behind. However the coziness and weekend-wind down you get from a nice Sunday is unmatched. The whimsy of Saturday would not exist without the humility and class of Sunday. </p>

        <p><b>Favorite dream job?</b> Circus ring leader. Imagine travelling in a caravan (with humanely treated animals) across continental America, pitching up your red and white striped tent in big field and waiting for the crowds to come and be wowed and amazed. "Ladies and gentleman" type of job.</p>
